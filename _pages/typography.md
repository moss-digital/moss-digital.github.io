Markdown uses headings to organize text and create a hierarchy of information.

## Heading Levels

There are three levels of headings in markdown:

# Heading 1

`# Heading 1` This is the largest and most important heading.

## Heading 2

`## Heading 2` This is a secondary heading that comes below the main heading.

### Heading 3

`### Heading 3` This is a tertiary heading that comes below both the main and secondary headings.

# Other Elements in Markdown

Markdown uses various typographic elements to format text and create a visually appealing document.

## Bold Text

**This text is bold using double asterisks.** 

```
**This text is bold
using double asterisks.**
```

## Italic Text

You can make text italic using underscores (`_`). For example:

_This text is italic using underscores._

```
_This text is italic
using underscores._
```

## Strikethrough Text

You can make text strikethrough using two horizontal lines (`~~`). For example:

~~This text is strikethrough using two tilde.~~

```
~~This text is strikethrough
using two tilde.~~
```
